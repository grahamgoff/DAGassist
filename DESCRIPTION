Description: Provides robustness checks driven by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Given a 'dagitty' DAG object and a model specification, 'DAGassist' classifies variables by causal roles, flags problematic controls, and generates a neat report comparing the original model with minimal and canonical adjustment sets. Exports publication-grade reports in LaTeX, Word, Excel, or plain text.
