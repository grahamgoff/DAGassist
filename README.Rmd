**An all-in-one DAG-driven robustness check.**
Classifies variables by causal role, computes the smallest back-door adjustment set, and compares the significance of the original and minimal models.


## Installation

You can install the development version of DAGassist from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("grahamgoff/DAGassist")

#load the library
library(DAGassist) 
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r run}
dag_assist(dag=test_complex, formula = feols(Y ~ X + Z + B + A + C + M | region + time, data = test_df))
```
