**An all-in-one DAG-driven robustness check.**
Classifies variables by causal role, computes the smallest back-door adjustment set, and compares the significance of the original and minimal models.


## Installation

You can install the development version of DAGassist from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("grahamgoff/DAGassist")

#load the library
library(DAGassist) 
```

## Quick start (console)

```{r run}
DAGassist(dag = test_complex, 
          formula = feols(Y ~ X + Z + B + A + C + M | region + time, data = test_df))
```

## Export your results in LaTeX, Word, Excel, or plain text

```{r export}
DAGassist( 
  test_complex, Y ~ X + Z + C + M + A + B, test_df,
  type = "latex", out = "man/figures/README-latex.tex"
)
```

```{r figure, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-latex.png")
```

## Controlling DAG-based additions

By default `imply` = FALSE so no variables are added to your spec based on the
relationships in your DAG. Set `imply` = TRUE to get the complete minimal and 
canonical adjustment sets, based on your DAG.

```{r imply}
DAGassist(
  dag = test_complex,
  formula = lm(Y~X+C, data = test_df),
  imply = TRUE
)
```
