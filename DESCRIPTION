Description: Provides robustness checks driven by directed acyclic graphs
    (DAGs). Given a 'dagitty' DAG object and a model specification,
    'DAGassist' classifies variables by causal roles, flags problematic
    controls, and generates a neat report comparing the original model
    with minimal and canonical adjustment sets. Exports publication-grade
    reports in LaTeX, Word, Excel, or plain text.
